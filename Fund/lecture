GE Everyone,

It is my pleasure to stand here and talk with you about the concern and the idea.
Thanks you all for organizing such an event like this. The event is very helpful.

The first I would like introduce sth about my self and my team.
My name is Huy, I am an Embedded Developer. My team members are also work in embedded domain and software engineering.
Our team is named Green Home. Our purpose and goal is creat something that can help protect people health and our living environment.

So far as you know, Viet Nam is one of the most nations which has very high cancer rate. In the past, we were never or very less hearing about the cancer. But today we hear it, we see it everywhere in newspaper, in TV and in internet.
One of the reason is that we eat poision everyday. We eat food which grows in polluted soil and sprinkle with polluted water. We eat vegetable with very high pesticide residual. 

That is why, we are trying to create GreenVeggie that can help us save our health, save your health and everyones.
So, what is Green Veggie.
- Green Veggie is a machine that can help you plant the seed/vegetable clean and safe.
- Green Veggie does not use any polluted soil, water or pesticide. It uses the clean soil, water and fertilizer which are verificated very carefully.
- In addition, we are trying to make Green Veggie can prevent the worms or bugs. Plant vegetable with Green Veggie bug is free. (We call it free bug).
- So with the above functionalities, we can assure that the vegeatable is growed very clean and safe.

- One more important functionality we would like to introduce to you is that Green Veggie is a automatically machine.
- It need very less interact of the user. All the user need is just put seeds and press power button. The rest is automatically doing by the machine. We think this functionality will very help for the busy people.

- The last but not least, it will be very wonderful if we can eat green, safe, clean and tasty vegetable in our daily meal. You parents, your children does not worry much about the food security because they know that it is made by themself.

That is all of my Green Veggie.
